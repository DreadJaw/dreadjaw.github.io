## About Me
Call me DJ. I've been involved in creating software and games for a few years now
with only a few getting up and off the ground publicly. I've been involved in creating
and building bots for the software [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) since about 2016.

I've been a musician since about 2010 going under a copius amounts of identities across
the internet and am working on a way at this time of posting to bring them all together.
